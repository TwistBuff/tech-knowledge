                                It's a small integrated circuit card used in mobile phones and devices to identify
                                and
                                authenticate subscribers on mobile networks. It stores unique identifiers,

                                3&#41; The top speaker in a smartphone is pirmarly used for audio output,
                                including phone calls, notification, alarms, and multimedia playback. Some
                                smartphones uses the top speaker in conjunction with the bottom speaker to create
                                stereo sound, enhancing the overall audio quality and depth

                                4&#41; The front camera of a phone comes with a specific number megapixels.
                                Higher megapixels usually mean more detailed photos, but image quality depends on
                                other
                                factors

                                5&#41; The power button, also known as the "on/off button", is primarly used to
                                control
                                the

                <p id="explainer"><b>OLED</b> stands for Organic Light Emitting Diode. It's a type of display technology used in screens, TVs,
                    and other devices. Unlike traditional LED-LCD screens that require a backlight, each individual
                    pixel in an OLED screen emits its own light when an electric current passes through it. This enables
                    OLED displays to achieve higher contrast, richer colors, and faster response times. Additionally,
                    OLED screens can be made thinner and more flexible compared to other display technologies, allowing
                    for innovative designs. </p>
